# Security policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please do **not** report a security problem in a public issue, pull request or
forum post.

Report it privately through GitHub instead: open the **Security** tab of this
repository, then **Report a vulnerability**.

No such button? Private reporting is not enabled yet: open an issue that only
asks the maintainers for a private contact, without any detail of the problem,
and send the report there.

Include, when you can:

- the version of the integration and of Gladys;
- what an attacker can do, and the steps to reproduce it;
- the log lines that help (remove tokens, passwords and addresses first).

The fix ships as a new version of the integration, and the advisory is
published once users can update.

## Supported versions

Only the latest release receives security fixes: update the integration from
Gladys before reporting a problem.

## Scope

In scope: the code of this repository and the Docker image it publishes.

Out of scope: Gladys Assistant itself (see its
[security policy](https://github.com/GladysAssistant/Gladys/security/policy)),
the Magic Home app and its cloud, and the firmware of the devices (report to
their manufacturer).

Keep in mind that the local protocol of these devices has no authentication:
anything on your network can control them, with or without this integration.
Keep them on a trusted network (or a dedicated IoT network that Gladys can
reach). The integration holds no account and no secret; its `/data` volume
only lists the address and the model of each device seen.
